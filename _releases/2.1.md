## Changes in v{{page.version}}.3

### New Features

* Introduced a way to invite a user into contract and workspace in one turn.
* Made Node.js SDK to disconnect from RabbitMQ properly. In case when one
instance of RabbitMQ fails or reports errors, the nodejs process immediately
exits and is restarted again by the platform orchestrator so that the process
can re-connect with the working RabbitMQ instance.
The `workspace_id` and `workspace_id` are introduced as optional attributes
to the `/v2/contracts/:id/invites` endpoint. If the `workspace_id` attribute
is provided, then `workspace_role` is required.
