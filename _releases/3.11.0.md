### New Features:

* The "Intercom" widget that is responsible for displaying the chat window has been moved under the 'Help' tab.
To contact our support team, please click the Profile's Avatar (round icon) button in a lower left corner and select the "Help" menu item from the list.

* As a contract Admin, I want to be able to see all workspaces in my contract.
The list of all Contracts' Workspaces is shown for the Contract Admin under the 'Workspaces' tab on the Contract's settings page.

* Introduced msg/size policies for local agent queues in the RabbitMQ. The limits depend on env variables RABBITMQ_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_QUEUE (default is 10000) and RABBITMQ_MAX_MESSAGES_MBYTES_PER_QUEUE (default is 100 MB). The actual values (for local agent queues) are divided by 10. Therefore the local agent queues are under limits 1000 and 10MB by default.

* The REST endpoints have been implemented.
In regards to a flexible "Role Model" we added the following API endpoints:
`GET /v2/tenants/:id/roles`
`PATCH /v2/tenants/:id/roles`
`GET /v2/permissions`

* Added a new label for marking depreciated or backward incompatible components' changes. By deprecation, we mean publishing a new component's version without any changes to it. You mark an entire component or its triggers/actions as deprecated. These deprecation messages are shown in the UI.

* The endpoint to get roles per contract. Endpoint GET /v2/contracts/:id/roles is introduced. In the first iteration, it returns all the roles that are accessible in the corresponding tenant.

* Frontend should support multiple user roles.
The multiple user roles should be appropriately displayed on a Frontend. Roles' actions to handle: view, assign, remove a particular role.
It means you can assign several Roles to a User while inviting him to a Contract or Workspace. You can also edit (reassign/unassign) Roles for already existing Users.

* API should accept multiple User Roles. The API User should be able to assign multiple roles to a regular user. The GET endpoints should return multiple roles as well.
To be able to assign several Roles to a User the {"role":"admin"} object should be replaced with the {"roles":["admin"]} array. Please see the API Documentation for more details.

* Reworked the output format for the /v2/permissions.
    Stringified the Scope->Object->Action permissions hierarchy into the '${scope}/${object}/${action}' string for the following endpoints:
    `/v2/permisisons`
    `/v2/tenant/:tenantId/roles`
    `/v2/contract/:contractId/roles`
Renamed TASK to FLOW, ORGANIZATION to WORKSPACE, ACCOUNT to CREDENTIALS everywhere in the System.

* Migration: admin->owner.
Now there are two default non-deletable roles in the System, such as the Contract Owner, and the Workspace Owner. All the existing Admins (Contract and Workspace) will be turned to an Owners (database migration).

* Dynamic User Roles support on the Frontend.
Retrieve an available roles' list from the Roles API (/v2/contracts/:id/roles), instead of using a hardcoded list.

* Migration: provide default roles (policies) for tenants.
The System uses per-tenant policies.
Please be informed that our internal system service Gendry installs non-deletable roles (contract/owner, workspace/owner) only. The migration service for installing the default roles (contract/admin, ws/admin, ....,) was created.
Please also be aware that all the predefined System's Roles have an additional is default field that accepts boolean values only. By default, it is set to true. Once a user initiates changes/edits to any of the Roles' permissions, the is default will be set to false. This does not apply to the Owners' Roles.

* The custom API for assigning a contract to a subset of the Tenant Roles.

### Requirements:
    -  configuring contract to have the only subset of roles from its tenant
    - it should be possible to get a list of visible roles (related to #959)
    - API should restrict granting an invisible role to a user.
    - the only roles configured in tenant policy can be enabled in contract
    - the only service account (appdirect) should be able to change such behavior. Probably tenantAdmin also.


### API modification:

1) introduce new attribute `available_roles`:
    - endpoints:
        - `GET /v2/contracts/:id`
        - `POST /v2/contracts/`
    - example:
        ```js
            attributes: {
                name,
                available_roles: [{
                    scope: 'workspaces',
                    role: 'admin'
                }]
            }
        ```
    - an empty array means "no available roles behavior" – all tenant roles are available
    - if `available_roles` is not empty – it always contains two non-deletable roles (`workspace-owner` and `contract-owner`), those items are paster by API implicitly

2) introduce patch
- `PATCH /v2/contracts/:id`
- authorize only for `tenant-admin`
- allow to update `available_roles`
- `name` updating might be implemented later later
- in order to "reset available roles" – client has to assign an empty array:
    ```js
        attributes: {
            name,
            available_roles: []
        }
    ```

* Open GET /v2/permissions endpoint to anybody.
At this moment /v2/permissions endpoint is authorized to use only by service accounts. But this endpoint does not contain anything secret, so it can (and should) be opened to anybody.

* Make workspace id required in one-time-execution run endpoints. endpoints `/v2/components/:id:/versions/:version/{select-model,verify-credentials,dynamic-metadata}` should return 400 error in case of absent relation with workspace

* It should be possible to suspend a contract
    Suspending a contract possibility
    The following endpoints will be implemented:
    `POST /v2/contracts/:id/suspend`
    `POST /v2/contracts/:id/unsuspend`

When a contract is suspended

    - users can login
    - users can not start flows
    - users can not retrieve samples
    - users can not verify credentials => can't actually create or edit credentials
    - users can't retrieve dynamic metadata
    - users can't retrieve dynamic dropdown models
    - users can't request agents
    - existing agents are "logged off"
    - users can't push components
    - users can delete their data (Flows, Creds, Workspaces, etc.)
    - users can not create new components, workspaces
    - all flows will be stopped (not suspended)


### API endpoints
    1. `POST /v2/contracts/:id/suspend` -- suspend contract. (mark contract as suspended, send stop to all flows, but don't wait. Wiper will wait). Allowed only for `active` contracts.
    2. `POST /v2/contracts/:id/unsuspend`. Allowed only for `suspended` contracts
    3. `GET /v2/contracts/suspending-contracts`. Internal endpoint, used only by wiper. Returns list of contracts that wiper should process just now. Not required to document (at least not for external users)
    4.  `GET /v2/contracts`  new attribute added: `status`. May have three values `active`, `suspended`, `suspending`
    5. `GET /v2/contract/:id` new attribute added: `status`. Same as 4

### Auth
    * New endpoints are allowed to use only by `SystemAccounts`
    * Old/Outdated endpoints (get the contract by id, get contracts list) work with the same authorization rules, as always. A new attribute was added. It is always visible

### Release process
This issue introduces migration and requires to configure 2 env variables `WIPER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME`  and `WIPER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`
Env var names are quite self-explanatory: login and password for system account used by the Wiper to finalize contract suspension.
Username should be chosen in some sensible way like `wiper`. The password may be any random string. To generate `pwgen` may be used
 ```shell
pwgen -n -y -s  15
```
Migration installs this service account into mongo to make it possible for API to authorize client that uses `WIPER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME` and  `WIPER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`

* Support suspended contracts on the frontend.
We show some notice/warning message on the contact page, to make it easy to understand that a contract is suspended. ‘“This contract has been suspended. Please, contact the support team for more information.” All the buttons that allow creating/editing any entities were hidden



### Bug Fixes:

* Valid step is displayed like broken
