### New Features

* Introduced experimental feature `keen flows`. All steps of a keen flow
are launched simultaneously when the flow is started and will run until
the status of the flow is changed to `sleeping`.
* Introduced a possibility in the UI to define a `CRON` expression for a
flow used to schedule the flow executions. This functionality is available
in the flow designer under the `Settings` tab
* Made Node.js SDK to disconnect from RabbitMQ properly. In case when one
instance of RabbitMQ fails or reports errors, the nodejs process immediately
exits and is restarted again by the platform orchestrator so that the process
can re-connect with the working RabbitMQ instance.
The `workspace_id` and `workspace_id` are introduced as optional attributes
to the `/v2/contracts/:id/invites` endpoint. If the `workspace_id` attribute
is provided, then `workspace_role` is required.

### Fixed Bugs

* It is possible to delete a credential even if it is used in integration flows.
