This document provides the basic information on [Local Agent](#local-agent) and the [way to get it](#how-to-request-a-local-agent) in case you require one.

## Local Agent
A Local Agent is VM-based application that allows you to create a secure connection between your on-premise database and the Platform, restricting any external access to it. It is intended for companies that work with clients' personal data, or just have strict data security policies. For example:

- Government institutions, military, law enforcement

- Healthcare and insurance

- Banks, telecommunication companies, etc.

Basically, a Local Agent adds another virtualization layer that emulates your own on-premise part of the Platform, securing all connections:
