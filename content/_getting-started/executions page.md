This document provides basic information on [Executions](#executions) and [Executions page](#executions-page).

## Executions
An Execution is the path of an initial message through a Flow. As the message gets into the Flow (generated by a scheduler, received by a webhook, etc.), it is assigned an Execution ID. This ID follows the message through the entire Flow, forming an Execution. Also, the same ID will be assigned to any messages caused by this initial message in the Flow. The following diagram demonstrates Executions using a Webhook flow:

A client sent two messages to a Webhook URL simultaneously. The A message was passed by the Webhook trigger to the next action as is. While processing the message the action produced 10 more messages which were passed to the following action. In summary we can say that an external stimulus produced an A Execution of 11 messages being processed in the platform. Similarly another external stimulus produced the B Execution with 11 messages. These two Executions are separated logically but not necessarily physically.


## Executions Page
The page is, basically, a list of all the Executions, which can be filtered by:

- Date

- Successful/Erroneous

- Flows  

If new executions are added to the list while you are browsing it, you will get a message at the top of the list, and a prompt to load them.

Since most of the errors inside components are related to data processed, Executions are beneficial for debugging integration flows. On the Executions page you can select a single Execution and, for example, check the errors that occurred. It is possible to use [Retry feature](/guides/error-retry.html) for errors:
