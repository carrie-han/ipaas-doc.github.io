This document provides basic information on [Executions](#executions) and [Executions page](#executions-page).

## Executions
An Execution is the path of an initial message through a Flow. As the message gets into the Flow (generated by a scheduler, received by a Webhook, etc.), it is assigned an Execution ID. This ID follows the message through the entire Flow, forming an Execution. Also, the same ID will be assigned to any messages caused by this initial message in the Flow. The following diagram demonstrates Executions using a Webhook Flow:

![Executions Webhook Flow](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/exec1.png)

A client sent two messages to a Webhook URL simultaneously. The A message was passed by the Webhook trigger to the next action as is. While processing the message the action produced 10 more messages which were passed to the following action. In summary we can say that an external stimulus produced an A Execution of 11 messages being processed in the platform. Similarly another external stimulus produced the B Execution with 11 messages. These two Executions are separated logically but not necessarily physically.

As for a polling Flow, everything works as shown on the diagram:

A polling Flow is triggered by a Platform internal scheduling request. As a result of this request, the Flow's trigger is executed eventually. The message emitted by the trigger is creating a large number of messages that all belong to the same Execution. In the example above 101 messages belong to the same Execution as they were caused by the same trigger message. A new Execution is created only in the next scheduling interval.

The action receiving the data is processing it in parallel or serially, and emits 10 messages for each piece of data. The last action of the Flow receives 100 messages totally. All the 110 messages belong to the same Execution.


## Executions Page
The page is, basically, a list of all the Executions, which can be filtered by:

- Date. The filter offers a calendar where you can set any required time period. Additionally, there are predefined options like `last 15 minutes`, `last hour`, `today`, etc.  

- Successful/Erroneous. Successful Executions run without errors. Erroneous Executions contain errors.

- Flows. The filter allows you to see Executions per selected Flow. You can select multiple Flows simultaneously if, for example, you need to debug related Flows.  

All filters are added to the URL code, so you can send a link to the filtered Executions list to your colleague. If new executions are added to the list while you are browsing it, you will get a message at the top of the list, and a prompt to load them.

Since most of the errors inside components are related to data processed, Executions are beneficial for debugging integration flows. On the Executions page you can select a single Execution and, for example, check the errors that occurred. It is possible to use [Retry feature](/guides/error-retry.html) for errors:
