This document provides basic information on [Executions](#executions) and [Executions page](#executions-page).

## Executions
An Execution is the path of an initial message through a Flow. As the message gets into the Flow (generated by a scheduler, received by a webhook, etc.), it is assigned an Execution ID. This ID follows the message through the entire Flow, forming an Execution. Also, the same ID will be assigned to any messages caused by this initial message in the Flow.

## Executions Page
The page is, basically, a list of all the Executions, which can be filtered by:

- Date

- Successful/Erroneous

- Flows  

If new executions are added to the list while you are browsing it, you will get a message at the top of the list, and a prompt to load them.

On the Executions page you can select a single Execution and, for example, check what errors occurred. It is possible to use [Retry feature](/guides/error-retry.html) for errors:
