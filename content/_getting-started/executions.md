This document provides basic information on [executions](#executions) and
[executions page](#executions-page).

## Executions

An execution is the path of an initial message through a flow. As the message
gets into the flow (generated by a scheduler, received by a webhook, etc.), it is
assigned an `execution ID`. This `ID` follows the message through the entire flow,
forming an execution. Also, the same `ID` will be assigned to any messages caused
by this initial message in the flow. The following diagram demonstrates executions
using a webhook flow:

![Executions Webhook Flow](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/exec1.png)

A client sent two messages to a webhook URL simultaneously. The `A` message was
passed by the webhook trigger to the next action as is. While processing the
message the action produced 10 more messages which were passed to the following
action. In summary we can say that an external stimulus produced an `A` execution
of 11 messages being processed in the platform. Similarly another external stimulus
produced the `B` execution with 11 messages. These two executions are separated
logically but not necessarily physically.

As for a polling flow, everything works as shown on the diagram:

![Executions polling Flow](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/exec2.png)

A polling flow is triggered by a platform internal scheduling request. As a result
of this request, the flow's trigger is executed. The message emitted
by the trigger is creating a large number of messages that all belong to the same
execution. In the example above 101 messages belong to the same execution as they
were caused by the same trigger message. A new execution is created in the
next scheduling interval.

The action receiving the data is processing it in parallel or serially, and emits
10 messages for each piece of data. The last action of the flow receives 100
messages totally. All the 110 messages belong to the same execution.


## Executions Page

This page shows the list of all executions. You can filter the executions
by [flow names](#filtering-by-flow-name), [flow statuses](#filtering-by-status)
and the [time interval](#filtering-by-time-interval).

![Executions page filters](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/exec-filters.gif)

All filters are added to the URL code, so you can send a link to the filtered
executions list to your colleague.

```
https://address-to-your-platform/c/5b62c919fd98ea00112d53ad#/w/57977bd3be64438036000003/executions?flow_ids=5dd0838225f7b3b4e8280b5c&time_from=2020-01-06T21%3A54%3A00.000Z&time_to=2020-01-06T22%3A54%3A59.999Z&thread_type=successful
```

If new executions are added to the list while you are browsing it, you will get a
message at the top of the list, and a prompt to load them or dismiss the prompt
by clicking `X`. The idea is to not let new executions interfere with your browsing
by messing up the list. The screenshot below shows a typical view with a message:

> **A Technical Note** - to benefit from this page, all your custom components
> must use the latest Sailor (above 2.5.4). It is advisable to restart all the
> realtime flows after updating your components.

## Filtering by flow name

This filter allows you to concentrate on executions of one or more flows by deselecting
their names in the drop-down menu.

![Flow Name filter with two selected flows](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/executions-filter-flowname.png)

You can select more than one flow if you need to debug related flows.
Here you can search for the flow names to find the relevant flows faster.

> **Note**, by deselecting all (*Clear*) you will return to the default view
> where all executions of every flow are shown.

## Filtering by Status

This filter allows you to list executions based on their statuses:
**Successful** or **Erroneous**. By default all executions are shown.

![Flow statuses](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/executions-filter-statuses.png)

## Filtering by time interval

This filter allows you to list executions based on their time. A drop-down menu
offers a calendar view where you can customise and concentrate on the time interval
when the execution was started.

![Time interval default view](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/executions-filter-timeinterval01.png)

Picture above shows the default view of the time interval where time is set to shown
today's executions. You can select any of the pre-defined options like
`last 15 minutes`, `last hour`, `today`, etc. Or you can customise it further using
the callendar view by selecting the starting date and end date. You can also select
the starting and ending hour of the interval.

![Time interval Custom Range](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/executions-filter-timeinterval02.png)

> **Note** - you must press **Apply** for it to take effect. You will know it worked
> when the check-mark shows the **Custom Range** and the name interval is clearly
> shown on the selecter manu instead of Today.


## Debugging the executions



Since most of the errors inside components are related to the processed data, executions
are beneficial for debugging integration flows. On the executions page you can
select a single execution:

![Execution](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/exec-retry1.png)

Then, for example, you can check the errors that occurred:

![Executions error](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/exec-retry2.png)

You can use [Retry feature](/guides/error-retry) for errors:
