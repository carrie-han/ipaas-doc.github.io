This document provides basic information on [executions](#executions) and
[executions page](#executions-page).

## Executions

An execution is the path of an initial message through a flow. As the message
gets into the flow (generated by a scheduler, received by a webhook, etc.), it is
assigned an `execution ID`. This `ID` follows the message through the entire flow,
forming an execution. Also, the same `ID` will be assigned to any messages caused
by this initial message in the flow. The following diagram demonstrates executions
using a webhook flow:

![Executions Webhook Flow](/assets/img/getting-started/exec-page/exec1.png)

A client sent two messages to a webhook URL simultaneously. The `A` message was
passed by the webhook trigger to the next action as is. While processing the
message the action produced 10 more messages which were passed to the following
action. In summary we can say that an external stimulus produced an `A` execution
of 11 messages being processed in the platform. Similarly another external stimulus
produced the `B` execution with 11 messages. These two executions are separated
logically but not necessarily physically.

As for a polling flow, everything works as shown on the diagram:

A polling flow is triggered by a platform internal scheduling request. As a result
of this request, the flow's trigger is executed eventually. The message emitted
by the trigger is creating a large number of messages that all belong to the same
execution. In the example above 101 messages belong to the same execution as they
were caused by the same trigger message. A new execution is created only in the
next scheduling interval.

The action receiving the data is processing it in parallel or serially, and emits
10 messages for each piece of data. The last action of the flow receives 100
messages totally. All the 110 messages belong to the same execution.


## Executions Page

This page shows the list of all executions, which can be filtered by:

*   **Date** - This filter offers a calendar view where you can select the required time interval to view the executions. Additionally, there are predefined options like `last 15 minutes`, `last hour`, `today`, etc.
-    **All**, **Successful** and **Erroneous** - All executions are shown by default. Successful executions are the ones without errors. Erroneous lists executions with errors.
-    **Flows** - This filter allows you to select executions per selected flow. You can select more than one flows simultaneously if, for example, you need to debug related flows. Note, by deselecting all (*Clear*) you will return to the default view where all executions of every flow are shown.

All filters are added to the URL code, so you can send a link to the filtered
executions list to your colleague.

If new executions are added to the list while you are browsing it, you will get a
message at the top of the list, and a prompt to load them or dismiss the prompt
by clicking `X`. The idea is to not let new executions interfere with your browsing
by messing up the list.

Since most of the errors inside components are related to data processed, executions
are beneficial for debugging integration flows. On the executions page you can
select a single execution:

Then, for example, you can check the errors that occurred:

You can use [Retry feature](/guides/error-retry.html) for errors:
