* `httpTimeout` - default 60000 milliseconds(60 sec), number of milliseconds for http request timeouts
* `httpRetry` - default 3, number of retry for http request

* `httpTimeout` - default 60000 milliseconds(60 sec), number of milliseconds for http request timeouts
* `httpRetry` - default 3, number of retry for http request

Contains array of items with properties:
