## Microsoft Dynamics NAV integration connector

This is a private connector to work with the Microsoft Dynamics NAV software in your integration flows, developed specifically to run on elastic.io platform.

The Microsoft Dynamics NAV integration connector supports both triggers and actions, which means you can use it either to execute or to act upon a certain event. For example, you can create and update contacts or push new products and new customers to other applications for further data processing. It is available in Java as well as in Javascript.

Due to the fact that it is under the proprietary license, you cannot change or extend this connector yourself. If you need some specific additional triggers and / or actions, please contact our pre-sales team at ps[at]elastic.io first to discuss the details.
