This document provides information on Flow management, namely the following
actions:

- [Start, stop, edit, delete](#start-stop-edit-delete)

- Copy Flow within the same Workspace, switch between *real-time* and *ordinary*

- Subscribe to errors, schedule via [CRON expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression)

-

## Start, Stop, Edit, Delete

These basic actions may be done via the [UI](#start-stop-edit-delete-via-the-UI), and via the API.

#### Start, Stop, Edit, Delete via the UI
