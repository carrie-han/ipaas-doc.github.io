This document describes the way to find errors that occur in your Flows, and deal with.

## Flow Errors

To see the list of errors, navigate to the Dashboard and click *Errors* tab:

This list allows you to address any error by Flows, Flow authors, and time. Let's take the first one and check it:

To access Component logs from the Error list, click Flow name to open the required Flow:

In the Flow, open the Component that failed to start:

Now open the *Logs* tab:

By analyzing the logs, you can, most likely, find the cause of the error, and come up with a solution.
