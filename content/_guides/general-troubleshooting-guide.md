This document describes common problems that you can encounter and the ways to solve them.

For your convenience, we divided the issues into three levels:

- [Integration logic](#integration-logic)

- [Component runtime](#component-runtime)

- [Platform issues](#platform-issues)


## Integration Logic


## Component Runtime


## Platform Issues
While the Platform itself is not error-prone, we surely can not predict every possible issue with custom Components and complex Flows. Check [this document](platform-behavior) for some details on the common Platform troubles and the general way to fix them.
