This document describes common problems that you can encounter and the ways to solve them.

For your convenience, we divided the issues into three levels:

- [Integration logic](#integration-logic)

- [Component runtime](#component-runtime)

- [Platform issues](#platform-issues)

Also, we came up with a few [examples](#examples).


## Integration Logic
The first thing you might want to do when encountering errors is checking the *Errors* tab on the Dashboard:

Now, the last thing you can do before writing to support is a manual go-through. Basically, you can just follow the Flow step by step and see where it fails to work properly. 

## Component Runtime
When it comes to Component problems, everything is quite simple. You can check what is wrong in Component logs. See how it is done [here](managing-flow-errors). There you will find all the information required to fix the issue. If the logs are inconclusive or bugged somehow, you should contact Component developer for assistance.

## Platform Issues
While the Platform itself is not error-prone, we surely can not predict every possible issue with custom Components and complex Flows. Check [this document](platform-behavior) for some details on the common Platform troubles and the general way to fix them.

If you encounter a Platform issue that you can not deal with, feel free to contact our support service. You can reach them by [email](mailto:support@elastic.io): support@elastic.io or via the UI. First, click the *Quick Help* (*?*) icon of the Navigational Menu **(1)**, then click *Help Center* **(2)**:

A support chat will appear for you to state your issue and get assistance:
